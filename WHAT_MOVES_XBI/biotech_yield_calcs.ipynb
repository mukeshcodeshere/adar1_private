When the economy looks normal (normal yield curve):\n","   - XBI usually goes up a tiny bit each day, about 0.05%.\n","   - The ups and downs aren't too crazy, with the worst day being down 4.7% and the best day up 7.67%.\n","\n","2. When there might be economic trouble ahead (inverted yield curve):\n","   - XBI actually does a bit better, going up about 0.06% per day on average.\n","   - But it's more of a rollercoaster ride, with bigger ups and downs.

When there might be economic trouble:\n","   - They still move together, but not quite as closely.\n","   - Their relationship is a bit more unpredictable.\n","\n","## Predicting XBI Returns\n","\n","We used a linear regression model to try to predict XBI returns:\n","\n","- The model does a pretty good job, with only small errors in its predictions.\n","- The most important things for predicting XBI returns are:\n","  1.
